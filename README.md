# Record time

I work in a job where I have to record my time for internal billing reasons.

It's a hideous task because it's hard to remember what you're
doing. The consequences of getting it wrong can be painful, over spent
internal budgets and such like.

To track time better record it more frequently and provide MI on what
you were doing: your calendar might be able to tell you that you were
in a meeting this morning, for example; or github might tell you that
you did some commits this morning, so did you write some code maybe?

This currently does the first of these things, pester you about your
time.

That's somewhat useful because if it pesters enough you can probably
remember.

It still can't pester so much you ignore it though.
